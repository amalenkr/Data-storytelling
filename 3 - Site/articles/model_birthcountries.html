Vogue Bad Press
Vogue has a long relationship with scandals and diversity issues as stated in the famous catchphrase “More issues than vogue”. The New York Times published in 2020 an article entitled “The White Issue” following the magazine’s September issue celebrating Black culture and the employee’s uprising saying the editor fostered a workplace that sidelined women of color.

Going Further
Cover of magazines, collection campaigns, photoshoots etc. are only appearances. Even though the change of mentality is showing more and more in the industry, the concrete changes are still cosmetic. As stated in a Business of Fashion study, when looking at the chief executives and C-suites of the biggest fashion companies, white males are in a majority.
“Diversity is being invited to the party; inclusion is being asked to dance.” – Verna Myers
Lupita was talking about a facet of racism called colorism. It’s the idea that, for people of color, lighter skin is more desirable. In the same way that white women will have an easier time than women of color, light-skinned women of color will have an easier time than dark-skinned women of color. So even though racial and ethnic diversity in fashion and the media is improving, dark-skinned women still aren’t getting the representation they deserve.
