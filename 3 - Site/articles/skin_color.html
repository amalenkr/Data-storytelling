Vogue magazine, one of the most successful magazines to have ever been published, was created in 1892. The magazine has a total readership of 1,398,00  and is accessible to all ages. It is considered as one of the most influential publications. Now acquired by Conde Nast, the magazine is specialized in beauty and etiquette for women. In 1974, Vogue became the first magazine to feature an African American model the cover. It is both a mirror and a shaper of model life.

Going Further
Cover of magazines, collection campaigns, photoshoots etc. are only appearances. Even though the change of mentality is showing more and more in the industry, the concrete changes are still cosmetic. As stated in a Business of Fashion study, when looking at the chief executives and C-suites of the biggest fashion companies, white males are in a majority.
“Diversity is being invited to the party; inclusion is being asked to dance.” – Verna Myers
