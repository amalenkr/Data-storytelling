	More issues than Vogue: Condé Nast's diversity problem
Nareasha Willis caught the fashion world’s attention in 2018 when her black sweatshirt, emblazoned with the slogan “ghetto until proven fashionable”, was worn at Paris Fashion Week by fashion stylist Melody Trend.

The sweatshirt, which Trend matched with a neon-green fur coat, cat-eye glasses and a crocodile bucket bag, was snapped by Phil Oh for Vogue, the picture ultimately going viral on Instagram.

The photo led to Teen Vogue featuring a glowing interview of Willis, a designer and fashion activist, with much of the interview discussing issues of cultural appropriation and diversity in fashion. Her fashion brand, Black Vogue, was praised as a brand that stylishly and courageously addressed major social issues, and Willis described being able to share her views on fashion activism in Vogue as a “dream come true”.

So – why has Vogue’s parent company been suing Nareasha Willis?

Advance Magazine Publishers Inc, the owner of Condé Nast, which publishes Vogue

(alongside a stable of other magazines), brought a claim against Willis in 2018, seeking injunctive relief and damages for trade mark infringement.

The law suit was filed after Willis filed a trade mark application with the US Patent and Trade Mark Office (“USPTO”) to register “Black Vogue” for use on hoodies, baseball caps, track pants, trench coats and swimming shorts, in a similar typeface to Vogue’s cover font. Willis had already created sweatshirts and tees featuring the slogan.

USPTO didn’t let Willis register the trade marks - they were too similar to Advance’s registered Vogue trade marks- but that didn’t stop Advance from bringing an action against Willis. Advance argued that consumers would believe that the two brands were affiliated, damaging its well-known Vogue trade mark. Willis resisted, despite having to create a Go Fund Me page to pay her legal fees.

The parties have now settled, and on 3 June, Judge Alvin K Hellerstein made an order that Willis and her company was prohibited from using the “Black Vogue” trade mark or any similar mark. Willis was also ordered to withdraw and cancel all trade mark applications and registrations filed with USPTO that included the word “Vogue”, including “Black Vogue”.

On one hand, Advance was entitled to protect its intellectual property. But on the other hand, the lawsuit was ridiculous and completely tone-deaf. Why did the media giant choose to go after a 25-year old, almost unknown fashion designer, especially when a quick Google search reveals hundreds of tee shirts ripping off the Vogue slogan?

But the lawsuit is also symbolic of the way that Condé Nast has traditionally dealt with race – championing cultural diversity, but only when it suits.

On 11 June, Matt Duckor, a Condé Nast vice-president in charge of programming, resigned after allegations that he masterminded a system at the Condé Nast-owned food magazine Bon Appétit that consistently favoured white talent and paid white editors (but not non-white editors) for video work. Adam Rapoport, the editor in chief of Bon Appétit, also resigned after a 2003 photograph of him dressed in “brown face” surfaced on social media.

Vogue itself has not been immune to criticism. Anna Wintour, the famous Editor-in-Chief of Vogue US (who is also Condé Nast US Artistic Director and Global Content Advisor) has been dogged by accusations of racism. Most notably, she snubbed Beverly Johnson, the first African-American model featured on the cover of Vogue, refusing to invite her to the magazine’s 100th anniversary party in 1992. On the other side of the Atlantic, Alexandra Shulman, the former editor of UK Vogue, only gave two Black models covers during her 25-year reign, and was openly criticised by supermodel Naomi Campbell for the lack of diversity at the UK magazine.

It was only in 2018, when Beyoncé was the cover star of Vogue’s September issue, that Tyler Mitchell became the first Black photographer to shoot a Vogue cover – and that only happened at Beyoncé’s request.

The exclusion of people of colour from Vogue’s creative talent was highlighted by the #VogueChallenge, which originated on TikTok in mid-May. The Oslo student Salma Noor first came up with the challenge, posting a black and white shot of herself mocked up into a Vogue cover, with a headline reading “Being Black is not a crime”. The challenge quickly went viral, with a diverse set of creatives using the hashtag to bypass fashion’s gatekeepers and showcase what creators and models of colour could do.

While Anna Wintour has acknowledged in an internal memo that Vogue has not “found enough ways to elevate and give space to Black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators,” others identify a toxic mix of racism and classism as the reason for Vogue’s historical lack of diversity.

Writing in the Business of Fashion, Bonnie Morrison, former Special Projects Editor at Men’s Vogue, notes that socio-economic class also needs to be added into the equation.

Morrison (who is black) attributes her warm welcome at Condé Nast to her privileged, Ivy League background, revealing that she got her first job through a parental connection to Si Newhouse, the owner of Condé Nast. She writes that “Race begins to fade from view when the signifiers of socio-economic status are on full display.”

Part of the reason that Vogue has been so white for so long, according to Morrison, is that entry-level fashion positions at Condé Nast typically pay so little that only candidates who are bankrolled by their families can actually afford to take them. She also writes that Vogue’s recruitment practices traditionally award posts on the basis of socio-economic status, “brand-name” schools or simple nepotism.

This is not to say that things aren’t slowly changing. Since the appointment of Ghana-born Edward Enninful as the editor in chief of UK Vogue in 2017, the UK magazine has become much more inclusive. Enninful is committed to surrounding himself with a significantly more diverse staff, and his tenure has seen Adwoa Aboah, Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Rihanna as cover stars, while another group cover featured hijab-wearing top model Halima Aden (a first for Vogue).

Let’s hope that the rest of the Condé Nast stable follows Enninful’s lead.

The last word should go to Nareasha Willis, whose brand Avnu still stocks a range of slogan tees, including the one which kick-started her fashion journey.

According to a statement by Willis, “I started the Black Vogue movement with one goal in mind: to start a conversation that was long overdue and to shake the fashion industry so that my people, people from the African diaspora, are acknowledged, celebrated and given their deserved respect and recognition. The fashion industry has lacked diversity for years yet it still continues to appropriate black culture via style, dress, hair etc. … I created ‘Black Vogue’ to address this problem and provide an outlet for black people to celebrate themselves.”
