Vogue magazine, one of the most successful magazines to have ever been published, was created in 1892. The magazine has a total readership of 1,398,00  and is accessible to all ages. It is considered as one of the most influential publications. Now acquired by Conde Nast, the magazine is specialized in beauty and etiquette for women. In 1974, Vogue became the first magazine to feature an African American model the cover. It is both a mirror and a shaper of model life.

Fashion press plays a determining role in this evolution. Condé Nast announced “Vogue Values” in December 2019 a pretty major ideological rebrand for its most famous title. The statement aims to act as a guide for editorial teams globally. 
						<br><br> 
						In 2001 already, the Belizean-American former world champion track and field athlete and a former professional basketball player for Tulsa Shock in the WNBA, Marion Jones, was on the cover of the Vogue US magazine. A way to take a step forward and change their editorial line. In May 2017, the cover was called : “Women Rule, Fashion's fearless females”. New rules claimed by seven diverse models, with colored skins or kinky hair. The subtitle "The beauty revolution, no norm is the new norm" is a stark contrast with most publications featuring in majority skinny white models.
						<br><br>
						If non-white models are chosen on US Vogue covers after such a long time in the world of fashion, the evolution of beauty standards is starting to become widespread. Even if this is far from rewriting the traditional diktats of fashion, diversity is appealing to fashion magazines, which do not hesitate to show clear improvements year after year. Despite this awareness, there is still a lack of different profiles. Except few colored women, most of the chosen ones have a medium-light skin tone.
